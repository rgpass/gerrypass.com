Sometimes we have CLI processes that take a long time.

> Long time: any length of time longer than one's attention span

When we're going about our workflow, we are hopefully working on the highest priority task. If that highest priority task has a long-running process, we want to be notified immediately when that long-running process finishes. There are a few ways we can do this.

## Strategy 1: The simple bell

```bash
# Run this command in your (bash) CLI then change tabs/apps
sleep 2 && echo -e "\a"
```

If you ran this in OSX's Terminal, you'll see the icon jump in your app bar. If you ran this with iTerm2, you'll see a OS notification.

**Note:** If you're using Terminal, you should switch to [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/). It's as simple as Terminal, but with lots of quality-of-life features (ex. multiple tabs, window splitting, customization).

You'll see you get a OS notification, but you'll it says `Session sleep (sleep) #1 rang a bell!` That's not very helpful since it doens't give us any context.

## Strategy 2: Voice FTW

```bash
# Run this command in your (bash) CLI
say 'done'
```

Now go ahead and make the computer say funny things for the next 10min. This article will be still be here. ðŸ˜„

This was great tool I used often enough that I added an alias for it. However, I found it to scare me sometimes and it would scare coworkers when were pair-programming almost 100% of the time. As funny as the first few times were and even when it's Halloween, being spooked is disrupting and causes us to get distracted.

## Strategy 3: Custom scripts

What we really want is a OS notification with custom text to tell us what's going on. This way if we're running multiple long-running processes in parallel, or sometimes we run one and not the other, we can get appropriate messages.

This is where [node-notifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-notifier) comes in handy. To accomplish our goal, we just need a basic title and message. However, [node-notifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-notifier) offers tons of customization.

So let's make a simple npm package locally and call those scripts.

**Note:** I use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) instead of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). All the Yarn commands I'm running have an equivalent npm command.

```bash
# Make a folder -- you choose where you want these scripts to live
# I chose ~/scripts/notifiers
cd ~
mkdir scripts
cd scripts
mkdir notifiers
cd notifiers

# Initialize the project and answer every question blank
yarn init --yes

# Add the only dependency we need
yarn add node-notifier

# Create our first script file. I'm choosing a generic one for long processes
touch long-process.js

# Open it up in your editor of choice
code .
```

Inside of `~/scripts/notifiers/long-process.js`:

```js
var notifier = require('node-notifier')

notifier.notify({
  title: 'Process Done',
  message: 'The long-running process has finished.',
})
```

That's all the code. Try it out by running it in your CLI.

```bash
# Run this command in your (bash) CLI then change tabs/apps
sleep 2 && node ~/scripts/notifiers/long-process.js
```

**Note:** If you run it directly without the `sleep 2`, you may notice that it hangs for a few seconds after executing. I have been using this script for months and never found this to be an issue.

## Aliases

Lastly, we want these to be easily called. I only want to type two or three characters to have these get queued up. That's where aliases, aka bash shortcuts, come into play.

In your CLI and your shell of choice, you'll have one of these files. Try to open each one of these until you get a file that exists.

```bash
# Stop when you open one and it has content in it
code ~/.zshrc
code ~/.bashrc
code ~/.bash_profile
```

> Tidbit: The `rc` in `.zshrc`/`.bashrc` stands for `run commands`

Now that we have our run commands file open, let's add some aliases. Near the bottom, or really whereever, as long as it's after where `node` is defined and set:

```bash
# I chose `pd` as short-hand for `print done`
alias pd="node ~/scripts/notifiers/long-process.js"
# I chose `sd` as short-hand for `say done`
alias sd="say 'done'"
```

To have these take effect, you can either open a new CLI tab or you can run `source ~/.zshrc` (or whatever the file was above that you edited).

To test it, just run in your CLI:

```bash
pd
sd
```

I use this script at least 20x a day at my job. We have pre-commit hooks that run lint, type-check, run tests, etc. that take ~20sec to run. We also have some DevOps scripts that take ~20min to run.

Without being notified, I may commit, go and look at other sites, answer Slack messages, and then come back, see that a test failed, and then have to rebuild the mental context. With this notifier script, I am alerted in just a few seconds that everything went well or didn't, so my mental context is still fresh.

## Recall

Recall is one of the best ways to optimize learning.

1. What does `rc` stand for in terms of `bashrc` or `zshrc`?
