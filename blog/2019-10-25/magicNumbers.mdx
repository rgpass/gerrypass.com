Magic Numbers. They are an anti-pattern because they are arbitrary and provide no context. This leads to confusion ("What is this number?") and fear of removing it ("I can't remove it. I don't know what it does.").

```js
cy.wait(250)
```

Looking at this code in isolation, it's impossible to tell what we are waiting for. But this is a contrived example so let's add typical context.

```js
cy.getByTestId('save-user').click()
cy.wait(250)
cy.getByTestId('select-user-1').click()
```

Even with more context, it's still _really_ difficult to guess what we're waiting for. While [waiting for an alias](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait.html#Alias) is a better and far less error-prone solution, sometimes it doesn't make sense. For example, waiting for an animation to finish.

```js
cy.wait(250) // for animation
```

The simple fix is to add a comment. This fixes the Magic Number _here only_. Adding comments on all the `cy.wait` calls, we will quickly notice a pattern that can be refactored for a huge readability win.

```js
// test.file.js
import { forEvent } from '../helpers'
cy.wait(forEvent.animation)

// helpers/forEvent.js
export const forEvent = {
  animation: 250,
}
```

By just adding this variable to our `helpers`, we solve the problems we listed. It's clear what we're waiting for and because of that, if we remove the animation we can remove this line with confidence.

## Recall

Recall is one of the best ways to optimize learning.

1. What is a Magic Number? Why is an anti-pattern?
1. When does it make sense to use `cy.wait(time)` vs. `cy.wait(alias)`?
1. What is one strategy for fixing Magic Numbers?
